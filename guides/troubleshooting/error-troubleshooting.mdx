| Code | Meaning | Typical fix |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **401** | Invalid or missing token | Add `Authorization: Bearer …` header |
| **403** | Key disabled / quota exceeded | Check dashboard usage or ask for upgrade |
| **422** | Validation error | Double-check required fields – most common: `user_id` missing |
| **429** | Rate limited | Exponential back-off, then retry |

## Common mistakes

<Warning>
1. You sent both `agent_id` and `user_id` *blank* – at least one is required.<br/>
2. JSON body isn’t an **array** of messages – wrap single message in `[]`.<br/>
3. Using an **expired** key from staging.
</Warning>
