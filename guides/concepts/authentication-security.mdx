## API Keys

Generate and manage keys in the [Flumes dashboard](https://app.flumes.ai). Keys are **secret** – never commit them to Git.

```text
Authorization: Bearer FLUMES_SK_abc123
```

## Scoping

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `user_id` | End-user or session isolation |
| `agent_id` | Multi-agent separation within the same project |
| `run_id` | Trace a single tool/chain invocation |

You can combine these for fine-grained tenancy.

## Transport security

All requests go through **TLS 1.2+**. We terminate TLS at AWS Load Balancers before routing to the service mesh.

## Data storage

- Hot memory lives in encrypted EBS volumes (AES-256).<br/>
- Backups are encrypted at rest and in transit.

<Warning>
We are **not** HIPAA compliant yet. Reach out if you need custom BAA.
